==[ 1 ] ON RESET ====================================================

1.1 Set screen mode to intro
This happens by default, as a screen mode value of #$00 is for the
intro, and the default reset routine will take care of this.

1.2 Draw the intro screen on screen
First, turn of screen drawing and ignore / skip over NMI requests.
Then we draw the title screen. This should be stored as efficiently
as I can think of.
All tiles for the tile screen are in the top four rows of CHR-ROM.
That means there are 64 tiles max. I'm thinking of the following:

#% tt vvvvvv
   || ++++++--- value (0-63)
   ++---------- type - %00: draw tile vvvvvv
                       %01: set ppu_addr high byte to vvvvvv
                            the next byte is always the low byte.
                       %11: draw shape vvv vvv
                            000 = black void
                            001 = T/B
                            010 = L/R
                            011 = random void
                            100 = TL
                            101 = TR
                            110 = BR
                            111 = BL

#$3F = end of screen

The intro screen data now is as follows:
    ;; Gow to row 5, column 12
    .db #%01000101, #%10001100
    
    ;; Draw 1.LEVEL:
    .db #$01, #$26, #$16, #$0F, #$20, #$0F, #$16, #$27

    ;; Gow to row 6, column 15
    .db #%01000110, #%10001111
    
    ;; Draw 01
    .db #$01, #$02
    
    ;; ... et cetera


1.3 Set start level pointer to 0
Since startlevel_pointer is a value in RAM, and RAM gets reset to
zero by default, this is nothing to worry about either.
