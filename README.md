# Crillion-NES
### A NES port of the C64 game Crillion.

Crillion is a pong-based puzzle game for the Commodore 64, made by Oliver Kirwa and published by Markt & Technik. In this game a ball, which can be recoloured over colour fields and as in Breakout resolve stones of the same colour, is controlled by the joystick. Furthermore there are pushable stones that pose unwanted obstacles and skull fields that cost a life. While the first levels are well playable, the higher levels need more thinking.

This is very much a work in slow progress. Join along for the ride while I try to make my first NES game from scratch. The goal is to create a 24kB ROM that recreates the original game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. A one-to-one port is sadly not possible due to the C64 resolution, but I'll try to get as close as possible.
