# Crillion-NES
### A NES port of the C64 game Crillion.

## Update 2023-09-13
The game is function complete and the first alpha release is here! If you want to play it, go to the output folder, download the `crillion.nes` file you find there and open it in your favorite emulator (although I encourage you to use Mesen). Please note that the game is optimized for PAL, but works on other TV systems as well.

## What is Crillion?
Crillion is a pong-based puzzle game for the Commodore 64, made by Oliver Kirwa and published by Markt & Technik. In this game a ball, which can be recoloured over colour fields and as in Breakout resolve stones of the same colour, is controlled by the joystick. Furthermore there are pushable stones that pose unwanted obstacles and skull fields that cost a life. While the first levels are well playable, the higher levels need more thinking.

## Controls
**START:** begin the game  
**LEFT/RIGHT:** select starting level (on title screen), move the ball (in game)  
**SELECT:** destroy ball (in case you're stuck in a level)
